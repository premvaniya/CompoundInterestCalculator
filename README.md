# 💰 Compound Interest Calculator

A simple Java console application that calculates compound interest based on user input. Built for practicing backend logic, user interaction, and clean output formatting.

## 🚀 Features
- Accepts principal amount, interest rate, and time period
- Calculates compound interest using standard formula
- Displays formatted output with currency precision
- Designed for easy extension (monthly/quarterly compounding, GUI, etc.)

## 📌 Formula Used
\[
A = P \times \left(1 + \frac{r}{100}\right)^t
\]
Where:
- `P` = Principal amount
- `r` = Annual interest rate
- `t` = Time in years  
- `CI` = Compound Interest = `A - P`

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Java 17+
- IntelliJ IDEA (Community or Ultimate)
- Scanner class for input handling
- Math.pow for exponentiation

## 📦 How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/compound-interest-calculator.git
   ```
2. Open in IntelliJ IDEA
3. Run `Main.java` from the terminal or IDE
